2,Disaster Event,Industrial,"On 13 June 1989, exceptionally heavy rain caused strong flows in the creek system to the south and east of the EMU mine situated in Leinster. The 450 south pit adjacent to the operating mine began to rise as the blocked creek system backed up and began to spill over into it. At the same time, the main AG pit began to fill with water.  The mining crew made preparation to vacate the decline. At about the time water began to overtop the narrow neck of ground between the two pits and to cascade into the south end of the main AG pit, five mining crew were attempting to retrieve a pump. The neck of ground separating the pits began to erode rapidly, increasing the rate of water flow into the AG pit. The Manager drove into the pit and down into the decline to evacuate the men.

Whilst negotiating a left hand curve 250 m west of the Granville Railway Station, the train derailed causing it to collide with the northern trestle supporting the Bold Street Bridge. The bridge collapsed on the train, destroying one carriage and crushing two others.  The derailed locomotive demolished the eight stanchions of the northern trestle, sheering a power pylon from its base before overturning. Eight people died when the top of the first carriage was demolished as it caught the power pylon. The second carriage stopped clear of the bridge. The third and fourth carriages were crushed when the unsupported northern span of the 30 m wide bridge collapsed, killing&nbsp;83 people. The following four carriages remained on the rails, causing injuries to 210 passengers.

16,Disaster Event,Transport,"On 5 June 2007 the V/Line passenger train 8042 was struck by a loaded semi - trailer at a level crossing on the Murray Valley Highway approximately six km north-west of Kerang. The train was en route from Swan Hill to Melbourne and the semi-trailer was on a regular freight run from Wangaratta Victoria to Adelaide South Australia. When the incident occurred the level crossings flashing lights and warning bells were operating.  The semi-trailer collided with the second passenger car of the three passenger car train. A large section of the body-side was torn away by the truck trailer and several seats on the right side of the car were torn from their mountings. The truck trailer then struck the front right corner of the third car breaching the occupied area. The draft yoke connecting the second and third cars fractured and the third car derailed both cars. Eleven train passengers died and a further 14 and the truck driver were injured.  The incident was reported by the train driver and others at the scene and the emergency service unit arrived on site at 1350 hours.

17,Disaster Event,Severe Storm,"In June 2007 there were five east coast lows off the coast of New South Wales. The first and most severe occurred over 8-9 June. Heavy rain, strong winds and large ocean swells resulted in widespread damage to coastal regions of the Hunter, Central Coast and Sydney Metropolitan areas. The Queen's birthday weekend east coast lows developed in a pre-existing trough of low pressure over the northern Tasman Sea. This trough was directing a humid north-east to south-east air stream across north-east New South Wales and there was a weak low analysed just off the coast near Coffs Harbour on 8 June. The low moved south along the New South Wales coast, before moving out into the Tasman Sea on 10 June 2007.  Thunderstorms caused record breaking flooding in Newcastle, with 164.6 mm of rain falling in 6 hours from 3 pm to 9 pm, causing many shops and businesses to flood and hundreds of cars to be stranded or swept away. This storm event is often associated with the grounding of the Pasha Bulker (a 40,000 tonne bulk carrier ship) which occurred on 8 June on Nobbys Beach in Newcastle and was not re-floated until 2 July. Approximately 6000 people were evacuated from Maitland (near Newcastle) when it was considered that a levee may have burst.  In the Hunter Valley it was reported as the worst flooding in 52 years. Major flooding in the Hunter River occurred from 8 to 13 June and in the Paterson and Williams River from the 8 to 9 June. Moderate flooding occurred in the Wyong, Colo and Nepean Rivers.  Ferry services were cancelled on Sydney Harbour due to the weather conditions. The Cremorne wharf collapsed and sank due to large ocean swells. Beaches were eroded at many Sydney locations, due to swells up to 14 metres high. High winds blew beach sand over 100 metres inland. Over 200,000 homes reportedly lost power in the Sydney - Newcastle area due to flooding and high winds. Many thousands of homes and businesses lost telephone services when telephone exchanges were flooded.  A natural disaster was declared in the Hunter Valley and the Central Coast areas. There were a total of nine fatalities associated with the storm. Nearly 20,000 calls for assistance were made to the State Emergency Service.

18,Disaster Event,Flood,"In late June 2007, the Gippsland area received record rainfall associated with an intense low pressure system. The substantial rain event followed the Great Divide Bushfires, when 1.2 million hectares of public and private land were burnt and large areas of soil were left exposed.   The storm in June 2007 resulted in major flooding and widespread damage. Seven rivers burst their banks causing millions of dollars of damage to homes, businesses and farms, as well as a significant loss of public and private assets. The rapidly rising floodwaters forced dozens of rescues and evacuations. One person died as a result of the flood waters. During 48 hours of torrential rain more than 1000 emergency service staff worked to save homes and shops in towns throughout Gippsland. Relief centres were set up at Bairnsdale, Lakes Entrance, Paynesville, Sale, Lucknow and Loch Sport and housed up to 360 evacuees. Volunteers also provided medical aid and catering with other organisations such as the Lions Club.  The State Government established a Flood Recovery Ministerial Taskforce, which assessed community need and planned the recovery program. The Taskforce announced a $60 million Flood Recovery Initiative covering among other things the cost of work on some 400 roads, bridges and 80 walking tracks spanning hundreds of km and clearing debris from the regions&rsquo; water supplies, catchments and recreation areas.

When the fire was at its worst, approximately 90 firefighters from Hobart and surrounding areas, more than 60 police and a number of ambulance crews were in attendance.  The roof of the Liverpool Street store collapsed and the structural damage was such that the remaining four walls had to be demolished to avoid damage to neighbouring buildings.

22,Disaster Event,Bushfire,"Victoria experienced a very adverse fire season during 2006 - 2007. Lightning ignited a number of fires on 1 December 2006 and some later merged to form what is known as the 'Great Divide Complex' fires in eastern Victoria. The area burnt mostly public land and was estimated to be in the vicinity of 1.2 and 1.3 million hectares by the end of the season. On 7 February 2007, The Great Divide fires were finally contained after 69 days. There were also a number of other fires (Tawonga Gap burned 33,500 hectares and Tatong burned 33,000). Despite the severity of the fire season, housing and private asset losses were remarkably low. In total, 51 dwellings of which 21 were classified as primary residences were destroyed and hundreds of stock and farm fencing were lost in the fires. One man died in a vehicle accident while assisting a property owner to prepare for fire impact.  Thousands of community volunteers and career emergency service personnel across state, regional and community levels worked in partnership to ensure the fires were eventually brought under control. A further component to the response was the support and assistance from New Zealand, United States, Canadian and interstate colleagues.  By 7 February, more than 1400 firefighters had been injured in the fire fighting effort (including bruises, cuts, blisters, burns, dehydration, broken limbs and spider bites). More than 400 St John Ambulance volunteers, including doctors, nurses and first aid officers provided medical assistance. On 16 December, 11 New Zealand firefighters were injured while fighting the fire in the Howqua Valley in north-east Victoria.  On 16 January 2007 power lines were cut which severely disrupted Melbourne electricity supplies. On the same day, a fire threatened to close Tullamarine Airport. The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) worked with Melbourne Water to keep the fires out of the water catchments.  A significant number of people were evacuated during the fires. Relief centres were established to accommodate evacuees. Some mountain tourist complexes were evacuated due to fires including Mount Buller and Thredbo Village in New South Wales, the latter due to a fire that started from a lightning strike at Hermit Mountain and crossed the border.  Victoria experienced widespread effects from the fires. Numerous schools in the high country and some parts of Gippsland were forced to close due to the fire threat and outside play at school was banned in some instances due to smoke haze. The smoke haze reportedly caused some respiratory symptoms and aggravated conditions such as asthma. Haze also ffected traffic and delayed flights in and out of Melbourne airport. On 20 December, the Environment Protection Authority recorded its worst bushfire smoke since records began, with visibility reduced to two km in Melbourne's central business district.  During the fire season, the Country Fire Authority, Department of Sustainability and Environment and Parks Victoria received operational assistance from other states and a significant international contingent:    ACT - 37 personnel  NSW - 1050 personnel  NT - 108 personnel  SA - 10 personnel  Qld - 14 personnel  WA - 20 personnel  Canada - 52 personnel  New Zealand - 115 personnel  USA - 114 personnel    The Victorian and Federal Government provided financial assistance to aid personal, physical and economic recovery from the fire disaster.

25,Disaster Event,Chemical,"At approximately 10.30 pm, on 23 March 2004, a hose attachment was made between the process water and the clean water pipe system in the Ranger ore processing facility, near Kakadu National Park. Early the following day, workers showering after the night shift complained of skin irritation and poor quality drinking water. There were also reports of nausea, stomach cramps and vomiting from drinking contaminated water. Energy Resources Australia (ERA) admitted there were at least 28 workers that either drank or showered in water that had 400 times the legal dose of uranium.  Initial testing by ERA indicated that the water had a mild acidic ph of 4.5 and an elevated uranium content of eight parts per million. In response to this incident, ERA decided to close down both the clean water and process water systems, send non-essential staff home and conduct an orderly shutdown of the mine and all processing facilities.  A report by the Department of Environment and Heritage concluded that the primary cause of the contamination of the potable water system at the Ranger mine was that an operator opened a valve connecting the water manifold at the Fine Ore Bin (FOB) Scrubber to a one inch hose. At the time of this connection, the manifold was also connected to the process water system. Unknown to this operator, the other end of the one inch hose was connected to the potable water system and the valve at that end of the hose was open.

40,Disaster Event,Transport,"On 6 May 1990, a Sydney-bound commuter train travelling from Newcastle crashed into the rear of a stalled chartered steam train. The 3801 locomotive, also bound for Sydney, had stopped on a rise from the Hawkesbury River and was building up steam to get up the grade (Cowan Bank) when the Sydney bound train emerged from the Boronia tunnel near Brooklyn and collided with the 3801.  The accident happened 5 km south of the Brooklyn Bridge, between the Hawkesbury River and the town of Cowan. A total of 93 people were injured and six people died. The front of the four-carriage Sydney train was derailed in the accident.  An interim ban was placed on the use of steam locomotives on the New South Wales railway system.  A Coronial inquiry found that a railway signal fault occurred due to sand being dumped on the rail by the driver of 3801 to provide traction when the train went into a violent wheel-spin as it approached the Boronia tunnel. A handbrake in one of the steam train's carriages may have been partially applied, the inquiry found, to cause the train to slow down. Just outside the tunnel, the driver opened the valve to full throttle and the steam train pulled to a complete stop and more sand was applied to the rails.  While the 3801 was attempting to climb the hill, the Sydney - Newcastle train was stopped at a red signal on the other side of the tunnel. The lights apparently fluctuated from red to green seemingly because of sand on the rails. When the lights stayed permanently on the green the urban train moved forward through the tunnel, when the crash with 3801 occurred. The force of the impact destroyed the last carriage of the historic train and demolished the front carriage of the Sydney train.

Already saturated catchments were inundated and major flooding quickly developed on the Warrego and Maranoa Rivers and many other inland systems. The towns of Jericho and Augathella were flooded and a section of the Longreach railway was washed away.  On the morning of 21 April, the Warrego River was rising rapidly. Later the same day the river peaked at over 8.5 m which was 1.5 m above the previous record. Levee banks protecting the town were ineffective and floodwaters spread through the town, necessitating the entire population of 3500 to be evacuated to the airport. Many residents climbed to their rooftops and had to be rescued by helicopter.  The low then moved south-east and torrential rains were experienced across large areas of New South Wales west of the Divide. There was major flooding on the Lachlan, Macquarie and Castlereagh Rivers, among others. The Bogan river flooded into Nyngan. Despite the residents' ttempts to raise the levee banks by sand bagging, the levees could not withstand the flood and on the 23 April, as the river surged to 5.2 m, nearly one metre higher than the previous record, most of the town was inundated. The population of 2500 was evacuated to Dubbo, 160 km away.  The low then moved towards Victoria and produced torrential rains over Gippsland on 20 and 21 April with up to 350 mm recorded over the two day period.

116,Disaster Event,Chemical,"On 15 February 2001, at approximately 11.00 pm, a fire occurred at a hazardous waste and solvent recycling facility in Bellevue, Western Australia. The facility was estimated to have been storing up to 500,000 litres of chemicals and toxic solvents, largely those used in the motor vehicle and dry-cleaning industries. The combustion of stored toxic waste together with flammable material contributed to the creation of a dense toxic smoke plume.  The fire was one of the biggest hazardous materials fire in Australian history. More than 2,000,000 litres of water were applied to extinguish the fire and over 350 FESA personnel, including volunteers, responded to the emergency.  It took more than two days to extinguish the fire and 50 people were evacuated.  The fire destroyed the majority of chemicals stored on the site and also burnt bushland down to the Helena River. Initial clean-up costs were approximately $5.6 million.Toxic fumes were discharged into the atmosphere and residue from the fire landed in surrounding areas and covered buildings and vehicles in the vicinity that subsequently had to be decontaminated. Public health concerns were raised about a range of experiences of exposure to contaminants emanating from the fire.  Hundreds of thousands of litres of contaminated water had to be pumped from drains after the fire and all drains had to be thoroughly decontaminated.  A specialised drum shredding and waste collection machine was designed and constructed. Six months after the fire, the drums were processed and the waste encased in concrete, painted in impervious paint and disposed of in a class four land fill.  The fire also held economic impacts as the company received the majority of Perth's hazardous liquid wastes and the only other facility was shut down by the government in 2003. Consequently, waste had to be transported at least 800 km for disposal. Bellevue property values were affected and increased regulation of hazardous waste and chemical industries was introduced.  A Health Register was established under the guidance of a Steering Committee following a recommendation from the Bellevue Hazardous Waste Fire Parliamentary Inquiry. The First Report found that of the 218 people that elected to be part of the Bellevue Health Surveillance Register, 60 per cent reported at least one symptom that they thought was related to the fire but most symptoms did not last long. Typical symptoms included sore eyes, coughs, colds, chest complaints, dizziness, vomiting, nausea and headache.  Due to the hazardous nature of the site, a proper scene examination and the origin and cause of the fire could not be established.

Apart from floods along the Barwon, Tully and Herbert Rivers, others to flood included Burdekin, Bulloo, Flinders, Thompson, Paroo, Diamantina, Georgina, Barcoo rivers and Cooper Creek. Almost a third of Queensland was declared a natural disaster area by the State Government in the wake of the extensive flooding throughout northern, central and western Queensland. In relative terms one out of three individuals were directly affected by the floods.  Wide spread floods caused damage to plantations, crops and infrastructure, which resulted in several large damage estimates. This included $70 million to cane and banana industries compiled with $50 million to existing infrastructure.   The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2000 damage at $12 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $30 million.",2000-02-05,28/02/2000,-16.92339897,145.7738495,0,0,10,0,12000000,0,0,0,0,0,Queensland

131,Disaster Event,Bushfire,"Prior to the events on Ash Wednesday a ten month drought had dried the eastern Australian forests out. On 16 February itself, there was low humidity, heat wave conditions and strong to gale force winds. Temperatures varied between high thirties and mid forties over most of eastern South Australia and Victoria with relative humidity generally less than 15 per cent.  The Victorian bushfire season had started in November 1982. There were 854 bushfires reported at this time including, Ballan, Mount Macedon on 1 February, Cann River and Mount Donna Buang.  On early Ash Wednesday morning there were 104 fires already burning in Victoria most controlled or contained, it was only after 2.00 pm that the situation exploded.  The Victorian fires formed several complexes.  1. Western district near Warrnambool. This fire started from a defective private power line. The resulting fire front was kilometres wide and moving at frightening speed. A cool change came through at 5.00 pm and the wind changed to the south-west. The fire headed toward the town of Terang. The fire passed the town to its north and was brought under control the next day. In total nine people died, 50,000 hectares burnt, 157 houses destroyed and 19,300 livestock was lost.  Another person died near Branxholme from a smaller fire caused by power line fault.  2. East Trentham&nbsp;- Macedon fire complex. This fire began around 2.00 pm near East Trentham due to two powerlines touching and sparking. The fire moved to the Wombat State Forest and burnt much of Bullengarook. The fire stalled for a while but upon wind change to the south-west the fire picked up again and headed toward Woodend with a 7 m fire front at 8.30 pm. It reached Macedon where people and animals sheltered in the Hotel protected by volunteers. The rest of the town was annihilated. After reaching the top of Mount Macedon it was controlled in an area that was previously burnt on 1 February. Seven people died, 20,000 hectares burnt, 200 homes destroyed in Macedon, 150 on Mount Macedon, 50 in Bullengarook and 20 in Woodend.  3. Otways complex. The fire broke out approximately 3.00 pm at Deans Marsh and moved toward Lorne eventually onto the ridges above the town on and down to the sand dunes with many people taking refuge in the sea. The fire moved to Aireys Inlet where the fibro houses were hit by walls of flame and a gigantic firestorm. The fire moved at extraordinary speed and next hit was Anglesea, where houses were lost but the main part of town was saved. The fire burnt on through the night toward Jan Juc and Torquay and was eventually contained early morning near Bellbrae. Three people were killed and 578 houses and other buildings were lost.  4. Upper Beaconsfield - Cockatoo complex. This fire began in Belgrave Heights south of Mount Dandenong. Half an hour later 10 km away, a fire started in Cockatoo and remained static until later that night. The first fire moved 15 km toward Berwick and Pakenham and firefighters were just beginning to gain control when the wind change came through at 8.30 pm redirecting the fire towards Upper Beaconsfield. Firefighters were caught in terrible circumstances leading to deaths. The Cockatoo fire began to flare at 7.30 pm. The fire went right through the town of Cockatoo as fire trucks had been called away to other fires. There were reports of women and children being sheltered and saved at a local kindergarten. The kindergarden&nbsp;building was later&nbsp;recorded by Heritage Victoria as a building of significance to be protected.&nbsp;In total, 27 people died, 100 were injured and 535 houses and buildings destroyed.  5. Warburton complex. This fire erupted in the foothills of mountain ash forests. The fire began in Millgrove at 7.30 pm and quickly progressed to Warburton. Approximately 200 people took shelter at the local oval and a creek in underground tunnel. Thirty houses were destroyed.  In Victoria in summary, 47 people died, 150,000 hectares burnt, 1620 houses burnt and more than 1500 other buildings were destroyed and 32,400 livestock lost.  South Australia  Major fires were burning by noon on Ash Wednesday, particularly in the Adelaide Hills, Clare Valley 120 km north of Adelaide, and around Mount Gambier, the south-east of the state. By 3.00 pm the situation was extreme. The cold front then hit with winds at 90 to 100 km per hour and the intensity of the fires worsened again. By 9.00 pm rain began to fall and the fires in the Adelaide hills came under control. The fires near Mount Gambier took longer. In total 28 people died, including three CFS volunteer fire fighters, more than 1500 people injured, 383 homes and 200 other buildings destroyed and 160,000 hectares burnt.

202,Disaster Event,Complex Emergencies,"The Lake Illawarra was a steel single screw steam turbine motor vessel, bulk carrier. The Lake Illawarra sank after running into and demolishing part of the Tasman Bridge that crossed the Derwent River at Hobart, 5 January 1975. The vessel was en route from Port Pirie in South Australia with a cargo of zinc. When approaching the bridge, the captain reduced speed, but was finding it difficult to align the ship to the central navigation span of the bridge. Despite several attempts to change the course, the ship was difficult to manage in part due to the lack of speed. The master finally called out full speed astern in a last attempt to change the course of the ship when the ship veered into the pile capping of Pier 18 and then Pier 19 bringing the three unsupported spans of the bridge crashing into vessels' hull. The ship sank within minutes in deep water.  Seven crew members on the ship died and four cars ran over the gap into the Derwent River, five occupants died while others managed to escape from the two vehicles which teetered on the edge of the gap. The collapse effectively divided Hobart in two. Police and emergency services were called into action and within an hour a ferry was traversing the river. The next day there were three private ferries and one government run ferry in operation. Eastern shore residents were severely hindered by the collapse as most hospitals, schools, businesses and government offices were located on the west shore.  A temporary bridge (the Bailey bridge) with one lane in each direction was built and opened to traffic on 16 December 1975.

374,Disaster Event,Bushfire,"The Alpine bushfires started on 8 January 2003, a day of Total Fire Ban. Lightning ignited 87 fires in the North-East and East Gippsland regions. Eight of these fires were unable to be contained; they joined together to form the largest fire in Victoria since the Black Friday fires in 1939. More than 40 fires were also started in New South Wales and Australia Capital Territory.  The majority of the area burnt in Victoria was public land, 1.19 million hectares of parks and forests, including 60 per cent of the Alpine National Park and 81 per cent of the Mt Buffalo National Park. Fire fighting efforts were made difficult in hard to access, remote forest terrain. Approximately 90,000 hectares of private land was burnt. The fires burnt nearly 800,000 hectares in New South Wales and Australia Capital Territory, bringing the total of land affected throughout the Australian Alps to approximately 2 million hectares. The immediate effects of the fires included reduced water quality and quantity, loss of vegetation and habitats, destruction of commercial timber infrastructure, damage to recreation and tourism infrastructure assets and destruction of cultural sites and farms adjacent to public land.  A Ministerial Taskforce, appointed by the Victorian Premier, announced a funding package of $70.6 million for recovery works on public land associated with natural and cultural assets and support for agricultural private landowners affected by the fires. This was the biggest bushfire recovery effort ever undertaken in Victoria at the time. The Bushfire Recovery Program for the environment and agriculture focused on four areas:  1. Asset repair or replacement in parks, forests and alpine resorts ($24.9 million)  2. Protection and restoration of water catchments and water supply ($23.9 million)  3. Restoration of ecological and cultural heritage values ($13.2 million)  4. Providing practical assistance for affected farm enterprises ($8.6 million) Assets lost or damaged included; 41 houses, 213 other structures, three bridges and 10,000 livestock.

376,Disaster Event,Severe Storm,"On 24 August 2003, a windstorm developed from an intense low pressure system over Tasmania and was felt along the eastern states from Victoria to New South Wales.  Tasmania  Tasmanian police removed trees blown on to roads by the strong winds on the Murchison Highway in Roseberry on the west coast, and a tree was moved off the Tasman Highway in Buckland on the east coast . Falling trees across power lines cut electricity to the Tasman Peninsula between Sorell and Nubeena.  Rain caused flooding over an extensive area of southern Tasmania and damaged the Buckland Bridge in Orford, which connects the east coast to the Midlands, to the point where it had to be closed for two days.  Police received approximately 400 calls for assistance, the majority from people in the Tasman Peninsula, Bruny Island, the Huon Valley and the east coast.  New South Wales  Sydney and Illawarra districts experienced gale force winds causing considerable damage to trees, boats, aircraft, buildings and power loss to 150,000 homes.

Community meetings were undertaken, both pre-fire and during the fire events, which assisted in keeping the community informed.  The immediate effects of the fires were displacement of residents and tourists, closure of schools and loss of power supply to many properties. Longer term impacts include reduction in tourism trade; at least 112 staff were laid off as a result of the fires.

484,Disaster Event,Flood,"On 20 May 2009 an east coast low formed off the south-east Queensland coast. In combination with a strong high pressure system in the southern Tasman Sea, gale to storm force east to south-east winds affected the northern New South Wales coast.  Consequently, heavy rain occurred over a large part of the north-east region during the period 19-23 May, with additional heavy falls on 20-21 May. This was the third major flood to occur in the Mid North Coast this year, compounding damage previously caused during the February and April floods.  Damage recorded in the region included winds of 130 km per hour at Byron Bay, closure of 240 schools, the Tweed area affected by a lightning strike disabling powerlines to the north and south of the region (12,000 homes and businesses), 16,000 people on the far north coast were without power overnight, 35,000 people isolated by floodwaters, an overall approximate 21,500 people isolated in the affected regions, and the Macleay River levee at Kempsey broke its banks inundating the township.

487,Disaster Event,Epidemic,"In April 2009, a new strain of influenza A virus called 'H1N1 2009 influenza' was identified in Mexico. Because of the speed the virus spread around the world and the fact that it was a new strain of flu, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic in June 2009. This H1N1 influenza strain is referred to as both 'pandemic flu' and 'swine flu'.  The first case of this new pandemic strain of flu in Australia was in May 2009. By February 2010 there were over 5000 people hospitalised and nearly 200 deaths due to pandemic flu. Reports indicate that most of those who died had underlying medical conditions, including cancer, diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity. The median age of death was 53 years, compared to the median age of death from seasonal flu from 2001 to 2006, which was 83 years.  The then Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, announced in a media release that as of 1 December 2010 Australia's Pandemic Phase moved from PROTECT to ALERT which signified the end of the H1N1 influenza pandemic in Australia. The Department of Health and Ageing reported that there were 44,403 confirmed cases of swine flu in Australia since May 2009, including 6767 in 2010.

Approximately 153 staff were evacuated from the plant. Nobody was injured, but the facilities were forced to close temporarily.  The incident caused Western Australia's domestic gas supply to be cut by 30 per cent, as the Varanus Island facility is a major exporter of gas to the mainland. The largest impact was felt by major industry partners of Apache Energy such as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Burrup Fertilisers, but the disruption in gas supplies also affected small businesses. A survey by the Western Australia Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that of 300 businesses surveyed, almost half said they had been affected by the energy shortage.  The West Australian Government laid claims against Apache Northwest Pty Ltd and its co-licencees, Kufpec Australia Pty Ltd and Tap (Harriet) Pty Ltd for 'failing to maintain a pipeline in good condition and repair'. However after more than two years of litigation, the state government made a public statement that they were discontinuing the prosecution due to legal technicalities.

552,Disaster Event,Cyclone,"On 4 April 1989, Cyclone Aivu crossed the North Queensland coast near the Burdekin River between Townsville and Bowen.  On 31 March a tropical low developed south-east of Papua New Guinea. It moved slowly west-southwest and the system deepened reaching tropical cyclone intensity on 1 April. Cyclone Aivu tracked south-east and then south-west at 15-20 km per hour and continued to intensify for some days. The cyclone then weakened but maintained severe tropical cyclone intensity when reaching land south of Townsville. Upon reaching the land, the central pressure was 957 hPa with wind gusts to 200 km per hour and a storm surge of up to 3 m. A person drowned in the accompanying storm surge south of the Burdekin River. The system continued to move west-southwest after landfall and degenerated into a rain depression during the next six hours losing identity two days later.  Cyclone Aivu produced record and near record April rainfall totals over large parts of the coastal and central interior districts of Queensland and some parts of New South Wales. The maximum total recorded rainfalls inland from Mackay over 24 hours were 581 mm. Severe local flooding occurred between Townsville and Mackay during 4 April with a flood peak at Mackay of 7.8 m on 5 April; the major flood peak measured 13.2 m on the Pioneer River upstream from Mackay.  In northern New South Wales, flooding occurred as a result of this cyclone and two people drowned in associated flood waters.

569,Disaster Event,Severe Storm,"On 28 and 29 September 2011 thunderstorms and heavy rain occurred across Victoria. A high pressure system moved in from the Great Australian Bight to southern Victoria making way for a low pressure trough that weakened as it moved across Victoria early on the 28th. The trough brought widespread rainfall and thunderstorms.  Melbourne recorded its wettest September day since 1916, with more than 48 mm of rain falling in the city in the 24 hours to 9:00 am. Electrical storms disrupted flights and public transport and left tens of thousands of homes without power. The SES was called out to hundreds of homes with falling trees, flash flooding, lightning and wind damage to houses. In regional areas hail caused significant crop damage in the Mildura area. Flash flooding was reported in Gisborne as the storms approached the Melbourne area.

588,Disaster Event,Flood,"On 27 November heavy rainfall occurred in the northern inland areas of New South Wales. Flood warnings were issued for the Macleay, Severn, Macintyre, Gwydir, Mehi, Namoi and Peel Rivers.New South Wales State Emergency Service volunteers prepared Wee Waa with food and emergency supplies, with predictions that the swollen Namoi River would isolate the town for some days. The rising waters made the roads in Wee Waa inaccessible to all but four-wheel drive vehicles. Water levels exceeded 6 m around 9:00 am on 27 November, before reaching 7 m on 29 November with major flooding.  Approximately 300 properties were isolated in Moree, and the town was cut in two after rising waters forced the closure of the local bridge.More properties were cut off in Gunnedah and the village of Garah, as waters in the Namoi, Gwydir, Peel and Mehi Rivers continued to rise. One person drowned after being pulled into a storm water drain in Bingara, near Inverell.  As the flood waters abated and moved downstream, the Department of Primary Industries were able to assess the flood damage. Hundreds of livestock, mainly sheep, died with most of the losses occurring between Garah and Weemelah. Fodder drops will continue to provide quality feed.  It has been estimated that approximately $52 million in flood damage has occurred to the cotton industry in the Gwydir Valley. The local growers' association says initial estimates are based on around 18,000 hectares; up to 30 per cent of the dryland crop and five per cent of irrigated crop being damaged. It warns these figures could worsen as the floodwaters move downstream inundating more cotton and upstream crops begin to emerge.  On 1 December 2011, the New South Wales Government announced natural disaster declarations following the recent heavy rain and significant flooding in Northern New South Wales; local councils involved include Moree Plains, Inverell, Armidale, Gunnedah, Narrabri, Gwydir, Muswellbrook, Liverpool Plains, Tamworth and the Upper Hunter Shire Councils.",2011-11-27,04/12/2011,-29.46429825,149.8447876,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,New South Wales

On 25 December, thousands of homes were damaged when thunderstorms swept across Melbourne, bringing flash flooding and hail. The State Emergency Service received more than 4200 requests for assistance, most resulting from hail damage, wind damage and flash flooding through the western and northern suburbs of Melbourne.  Severe thunderstorms first developed to the west of Melbourne, south-east of Ballan, at approximately 2.30 pm on Christmas Day.&nbsp;During the next seven hours up to five long-lived supercells (very severe long lasting thunderstorm cells) moved eastwards across the northern suburbs of Melbourne.

595,Disaster Event,Complex Emergencies,"On 21 December 2011 a tropical low formed within an active monsoon trough over the Arafura Sea, north of the Top End in the Northern Territory. During 23-24 December, the tropical low began intensifying and at 3.30 am on Christmas Day the tropical low was named Tropical Cyclone Grant, approximately 60 km north of the Cobourg Peninsula.  Tropical Cyclone Grant intensified to a category 2 tropical cyclone at 3.30 pm and made landfall on the Cobourg Peninsula at 9 pm.  Tropical Cyclone Grant weakened rapidly once over land and was downgraded to below tropical cyclone intensity at 12.30 pm on 26 December, approximately 30 km north-west of Jabiru.  The Cyclone reached a maximum sustained wind speed of 100 km per hour, a maximum wind gust of 140 km per hour and a lowest central pressure of 978 hPa. Grant caused torrential rainfall over parts of the Cobourg Peninsula and the adjacent north coast of the Arnhem district.  Many trees were brought down in the community of Minjilang on the Cobourg Peninsula and the surrounding outstations and power supply was interrupted. Coastal erosion and minor flooding of low lying coastal areas was reported between the Cobourg Peninsula and Nhulunbuy due to spring tides, larger than usual swell and strong onshore monsoonal winds.  Overnight on 26 December and during the early morning of 27 December heavy rainfall occurred over the Edith, Cullen and Fergusson River Catchments, including 385 mm at Edith River Falls in the 24 hours to 9 am on 27 December, resulting in flash flooding along those rivers.  A rapid river rise damaged the Edith River railway bridge, causing a 20 wagon freight train to derail while crossing over it. The train was carrying 1500 tonnes of copper concentrate from OZ Minerals' Prominent Hill copper mine in South Australia when it derailed and up to 1200 tonnes of the substance spilled into the Edith River.  The copper concentrate from Oz Minerals' mine contains less than 0.008 per cent of uranium, which equates to 96 kg in 1200 tonnes of copper concentrate. Northern Territory Environment Department Chief Executive Jim Grant said copper concentrate is an&nbsp;environmental hazard and a threat to aquatic life, but that although it contains arsenic and silica it is not rated as highly toxic.  The two drivers of the crash were airlifted to Katherine for treatment of minor injuries and the 200 passengers on board were temporarily stranded.

One hundred and twenty Australian Defence Force soldiers assisted with the clean up in these regions.  On 5 February mandatory evacuations were ordered for St George after it was predicted the Balonne River would peak at up to 15 m. With more than 2600 people from a population of 3000 evacuated, it was Queensland&rsquo;s largest evacuation in history. The Balonne River in St George passed its previous record of 13.48 m, peaking at 13.93 m, but the township remained protected by its 14.5 m levee with damage restricted to the 50 homes. St George also faced pollution problems as floodwaters damaged the local sewerage treatment plant, posing a major public health risk.  At the beginning of March, a category one cyclone off the south-east coast caused further flooding and six evacuation centres were opened across the coast to assist evacuated and displaced people.  The National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA) identified the Local Government Areas of Aurukun, Burdekin, Burke, Cairns, Carpentaria, Cassowary Coast, Charters Towers, Cook, Doomadgee, Hinchinbrook, Kowanyama, Mackay, Mapoon, Mornington, Napranum, Northern Peninsula, Palm Island, Pormpuraaw, Tablelands, Townsville City, Torres Strait Islands and Yarrabah as natural disaster zones. To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments total approximately $11,749,000 allocated to 10,293 claimants.  On 3 January one person died when their car was swept off a causeway into floodwaters in Roma. Another person died on 5 March after being swept away by waters near Gympie, north of Brisbane.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the preliminary 2012 damage at $124.7 million.

615,Disaster Event,Flood,"Heavy rain began in Victoria on 26 February 2012. A severe weather warning for flash flooding was issued for most of the state, including the South West, North Central, Northern Country, Wimmera, Mallee, Central, West and South Gippsland and North-East forecast districts.  The State Emergency Service (SES) responded to 650 calls for help across the state on the last days of February following heavy rain and thunderstorms. There was flash flooding and minor building damage across the state after rainfalls of between 50 and 100 mm. In towns such as Seymour there was 120 mm of rain causing flash flooding and road closures. Shops in the main street of Chiltern were flooded after 94 mm of rain fell. The Goulburn Valley Highway was closed north of Seymour due to rainfall. Broken Weir near Benalla recorded the highest rainfall with 167 mm. Castlemaine received 50 mm of rain in a 90 minute period. Police said 11 homes and six shops were flooded.  State Emergency Service (SES) crews were also kept busy dealing with flash flooding at Yarrawonga, Cobram and Shepparton. In addition they had over 350 calls for help in Melbourne, with the hardest hit areas including Brimbank, Doncaster, Emerald and Malvern. There were 89 calls for help in the Ballarat area when storms dumped almost 60 mm of rain. The Daylesford Hospital had some minor flooding, and streets and at least one building were flooded in the area.  On 1 March 2012, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a Severe Weather Warning for heavy rain for residents in the Northern Country, East Gippsland and North East forecast districts.  Broken Creek&nbsp;broke its banks&nbsp;and flooded the town of&nbsp;Numurkah, north of Shepparton.&nbsp;Numurkah Base Hospital and the adjoining Karinya Nursing Home both experienced flooding, with&nbsp;patients and residents evacuated.&nbsp;Flood waters peaked on 5 March and slowly receded with a State Emergency Service spokeswoman saying it would take at least a week for the water to recede completely. Approximately 40 homes and businesses were damaged. The hospital was later delared unsalvagable and limited services resumed from a temporary tent facility, followed by longstanding portables.  Locals and the SES in Nathalia constructed a temporary metal levee with thousands of sandbags, 750 m in length along the banks of Broken Creek, in an attempt to protect the town. Nathalia's temporary levee was purchased after floods hit the town in 1993; it has not been used until this event and it supplements a permanent levee around much of the Nathalia stretch of Broken Creek. Notwithstanding the levee the SES still issued an evacuation order for the town of Nathalia as some doubt existed as to the levees ability to contain the flood waters.  Flooding of Broken Creek, which flanks Nathalia, peaked on 9 March at 3.25 m. The town's evacuation notice was lifted 15 March 2012 and the metal levee dismantled on 20 March 2012.  To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments total approximately $7,773,000 allocated to 6897 claimants.

627,Disaster Event,Bushfire,"On 8 January 2003, a combination of extreme weather conditions (high temperatures of above 37 &ordm;C, low humidity, lightning strikes and strong gusty winds) caused multiple bushfires to break out in the Kosciuszko and Namadgi National parks surrounding Canberra.  On 18 January, two fire fronts combined to create a 25 km fire front and wind gusts of up to 65 km per hour propelled the fire towards Canberra. The Chief Minister declared a state of emergency at 2.45 pm and the firestorm hit the outer streets of Duffy at approximately 3 pm, and soon reached the suburbs of Rivett, Chapman, Kambah, Higgins, Hawker and Cook.  Four people were killed by the fires, more than 435 people&nbsp;were injured and there were 5000 evacuations. Approximately 160,000 hectares were burnt which equated to almost 70 per cent of the ACT's pasture, forests and nature parks including Namadgi National Park, Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve and all government pine forest west of the Murrumbidgee River Stromlo pine plantation. There were approximately 488 houses destroyed and many more were damaged.  The Chief Minister and Cabinet Inquiry into the Operational Response to the January 2003 bushfires made 61 recommendations.

2029,Disaster Event,Flood,"Commencing 4 June 2012, up to 200 mm of rain fell in eastern Victoria, breaking daily rainfall records for June at 23 locations across the state, mainly Gippsland. Many Gippsland locations received a month's rainfall in one day. Up to 100 residents in low-lying parts of Traralgon evacuated their homes when the Traralgon Creek flooded, 45 homes were flooded.  The main road through the region, the Princes Highway, was closed between Rosedale and Traralgon and also east of Orbost due to flood.&nbsp;Wind gusts of up to 150 km per hour brought down trees and blocked parts of the South Gippsland and Monaro highways.  Major flood warnings were issued for the Avon, Macalister, Mitchell, Thomson, Tanjil and Buchan Rivers and the Traralgon Creek. The Yallourn coal mine flooded when the Morwell River burst its banks on early June impacting on coal conveyers and therefore the operation of electricity generators. The operator TRUenergy announced it should be able to restore three of the plant's four generators by the end of June.  The State Emergency Service received 1200 requests for assistance across the state including 450 calls for trees that had fallen and blocked traffic.  Early estimates of flood damage are being assessed, but damage to council infrastructure alone is expected to exceed $10 million. The Department of Human Services paid out Government grants totaling $125,000 to flood-affected residents.  The Victorian Governments Deputy Premier Peter Ryan announced emergency flood assistance grants. Adults are entitled to $480 and children $240, up to a total of $1200.  A media release by the then Federal Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon on 28 June 2012 stated that Victorians affected by flooding in South-Eastern Metropolitan Melbourne and West Gippsland on 22-24 June 2012&nbsp;would be able to get financial assistance in the five local government areas of Baw Baw, Bass Coast, Cardinia, Latrobe and South Gippsland.

2118,Disaster Event,Severe Storm,"Southern Western Australia experienced a number of widespread storms over a week commencing with a tornado hitting the Perth suburbs of Dianella and Morley on 7 June 2012. The tornado uprooted trees, brought down power lines, and lifted roofs from buildings. Reportedly the tornado only lasted approximately 10 minutes, but the winds up to 125 km per hour caused damage expected to be worth millions of dollars.  A further storm hit 10 June with winds of up to 140 km per hour lashing the south-west. Hundreds of power lines, street light wires and service wires came down in the storm. Some residents were warned they maybe without electricity for up to a week after more than 110,000 homes were affected. The weather bureau described the storm as a 'once in a decade' event.  In Bunbury, cars, buildings and infrastructure were damaged. Residents reported damage to houses, downed power lines, and debris spread across roads.  The State Emergency Service received hundreds of calls for help, mostly for damaged roofs and powerlines.  A man died after falling from a storm damaged roof south of Perth.  On 12 June, a third severe storm hit southern Western Australia in a week. Winds up to 113 km per hour, thunder and heavy rain caused power outages to 34,000 properties throughout the state. The storm hit the Perth metropolitan area at approximately 9.30 pm (AWST), bringing wind gusts of 107 km per hour as well as heavy rain and thunder for most of the night.  The Fire and Emergency Services Authority (FESA) answered more than 118 calls for help.  There was no major damage from the third storm.

3301,Disaster Event,Flood,"Between 10 -14 March 2011, the central and eastern Kimberley regions of Western Australia experienced extremely heavy rainfall, with more than 700 mm falling during the month over the Kimberley Plateau, caused by an active monsoon trough. A further slow moving tropical low caused extensive flood damage to infrastructure across the Fitzroy, Ord and Pentecost River catchments areas.  A number of towns in the Kimberley region broke their highest March rainfall records including Warmun, Yulmbu and Gibb River.  In the east Kimberley town of Warmun up to 500 people were evacuated when the town's 76 houses were either destroyed or deemed uninhabitable through flood inundation.&nbsp;Within days more than 290 members of the Warmun community were evacuated to the Ord Stage II Camp (Garrjang) in Kununurra.  The Western Australian state government immediately pledged the initial sum of $500,000 to contribute toward the rebuilding of the town. The state government further contributed $15 million to construct a 200 bed temporary accommodation for the community. The federal government committed to reimburse 50 per cent of the cost through the National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements.&nbsp;  The Department of Housing allocated $9.5 million to repair the damaged roads and create new roads to the newly built replacement homes. The town also received more than $8 million from the federal government to help with recovery. The funding would be provided over two years under the Community Development Employment Projects program. Funds were allocated towards projects to enhance the economic and social development of the community, such as rebuilding and creating opportunities for locals to develop work skills to contribute to their community.

3315,Disaster Event,Environmental,"The Big Dry was a period of drought that commenced in 1996, worsening in 2002 and 2007 with Australia finally being declared drought free in April 2012.  Southern areas of Victoria and South Australia and north-eastern area of Tasmania starting experiencing periods of rainfall deficiency in 1996. Conditions improved temporarily in these states by around 1999-2000 when the south-west of Western Australia and southern Queensland commenced experiencing rainfall deficiencies.  By August 2002 severe rainfall deficiencies developed across much of eastern Australia following poor autumn and early winter rains. Parts of south-west Western Australia were deficient in growing season rainfall for the third successive year. All states were affected. January 2003 was one of the driest months on record. Most of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and parts of Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia were affected. In February, Queensland and New South Wales received some relieving rainfall; however June rains were still well below average.  In January 2004 the Bureau of Meteorology announced 18 month rainfall deficiencies in part of eastern and northern Australia. This made it to 23 months by June. In general the south-east areas of Australia received below average rainfall for most of the last eight year period. Good rains in November removed or decreased rainfall deficiencies over many areas, with some deficiencies persisting in southern parts of Western Australia and central Queensland.  The year 2005 saw rainfall deficiencies in South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. Victoria and South Australia had the driest autumn on record. Good rains in October and November improved conditions in Queensland. In the years 2006-2007, Australia experienced an El Nino event. June 2006 saw poor to record low autumn rains for the sixth year in south-eastern Australia. A distinct turn for the worse occurred in August when near total failure of late winter and spring rains occurred. In June 2007 some easing of severe drought conditions had occurred from autumn rains in New South Wales, north-west Victoria, Tasmania, southern parts of South Australia. Some areas of east Queensland, southern Victoria (near Melbourne) and west Western Australia missed out. May 2008 was the driest May on record and rainfall deficiencies were evident for a 12 month period in eastern South Australia, southern Northern Territory and parts of Victoria and Western Australia.  November 2008 rainfall was above to very much above average over much of Australia. The rain largely cleared short-term rainfall deficiencies, especially in the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia; however, average to below average falls in western Victoria and south-eastern South Australia maintained deficiencies in these areas.  The autumn of 2010 was the first autumn with above average rainfall since 2000 in Victoria and the Murray Darling Basin. Serious to severe rainfall deficiency continued in the western area of Western Australia, some shortfall in southern Tasmania and north-eastern New South Wales. Due to excessively dry soils significant rain was required to alleviate the shortage of water across the country resulting from prolonged drought conditions.  December 2010 saw Australia record the wettest spring for the months of September to November with an average of 163 mm of rain beating the previous record by 23 mm. The widespread above average rainfall again missed the south-west corner of Western Australia which experienced a record dry year. Northern and eastern parts of the country continued to receive above to very much above average rainfall, with Queensland, New South Wales and the Northern Territory all recording their wettest spring on record. All states recorded above average rainfall for spring, with all states except Tasmania recording totals placing them in their ten wettest springs on record.  Despite the above average rainfall by mid-2010 water storages had still not returned to pre-drought levels. Irrigated industries such as the Murray-Darling Basin were particularly affected where water storage levels fell to 17 per cent of capacity in 2003 and remained below pre-drought levels until late 2011.  By mid-2010 the Australian Government had paid approximately $4.4 billion in direct drought assistance to affected farmers.

3413,Disaster Event,Bushfire,"In early January 2013 up to 40 fires were burning throughout Tasmania in hot windy conditions. The main fire that started near Forcett caused significant damage to local townships, particularly Dunalley, east of Hobart, where more than half of the town&rsquo;s buildings and a primary school were destroyed. Other significant fire fronts were located at Lake Repulse and Bicheno.  The Forcett fire was first reported in bushland outside the town heading towards Dunalley, on Thursday 3 January 2013 at approximately 2.00 pm. The fire escaped containment lines the following afternoon fanned by strong winds and burned towards the coast at several points. More than 100 properties were destroyed and 2500 hectares of land were burnt by the afternoon of 6 January. At least 80 properties were either damaged or destroyed in Dunalley and nearby Boomer Bay, approximately 20 houses were destroyed at Murdunna and 40 per cent of structures were lost at Connelly&rsquo;s Marsh. The fire threatened the town of Taranna and on 14 January 2013 a Victorian volunteer firefighter was killed when undertaking back burning operations in the vicinity. An estimated 24,000 hectares were burnt in the fire and at its peak the perimeter of the fire approximated 200 km.  Thousands of locals and tourists were stranded as a result of the Forcett bushfire which effectively cut the Tasman Peninsula off from the rest of the state. The peninsula's main access road, the Arthur Highway, was closed from 4&nbsp;to 13 January. People converged on Port Arthur to await evacuation by sea or road and due to shortages of food and other supplies, the community arranged for a fleet of boats to make deliveries to those stranded on the peninsula. Two private catamaran operators in Hobart were asked by police to help evacuate people from the Nubeena jetty.&nbsp; Evacuees were then taken to Hobart where they were met by relatives and friends or taken in by volunteers.  The Highway was partially opened on 11 January to allow stranded people and supplies to get through and was eventually opened to general traffic on 13 January.  Community refuges were established at the Sorrell Memorial Hall, Nubeena Community Centre, Bicheno Community Hall and Swansea Football Ground. There was also a Recovery Centre established at City Hall, Hobart.  The electricity company, Aurora, reported approximately 300 electricity poles were destroyed on the Tasman Peninsula, consequently power outages are expected to be an issue for a considerable time.  Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments were made available to residents in the south-east and east of Tasmania, covering the affected local government areas of Sorell, Tasman and Glamorgan-Spring Bay. Other grants made available were immediate cash assistance grants, housing assistance grants, Aurora energy assistance and clean-up and assistance grants. A first stage recovery payment from the Red Cross Appeal Distribution Committee was distributed, providing $3000 per adult and $1000 per child by late January. The Department of Human Services has allocated over $7,845,000&nbsp;to cover approximately 6900 claims.  The Insurance Council of Australia advised as at 1 February 2013 that 1783 insurance claims had been received with losses estimated at $86.7 million, about 85 per cent of these related to property, seven per cent for domestic vehicles, with the balance consisting of smaller claims for other losses.  The fire at Lake Repulse burnt more than 12,000 hectares and threatened the towns of Ellendale Ouse, Karanja, Westerway and Hamilton. Police allege it was started by an unattended campfire. The fire burnt for up to two weeks and was handed back to regional firefighters when conditions eventually improved. The other significant fire front was at Bicheno and Coles Bay where up to 15 properties were lost.  These fires were described as the worst in almost half a century. On 14 January a Tasmanian Bushfire Recovery Taskforce was established and the state moved to recovery mode. The taskforce estimated that rebuilding communities could take up to two years, with contractors expected to start clearing damaged properties by the end of January.

3437,Disaster Event,Bushfire,"During January 2013, New South Wales experienced very challenging fire danger weather conditions resulting in multiple fires across the state. By 8 January, there were over 100 fires burning, fueled by 40 degree Celsius temperatures.&nbsp;  The worst fire occured on 13 January when a fast moving bushfire in the Warrumbungle National Park near Coonabarabran destroyed more than 51 nearby homes and damaged many others. The lodge at the Siding Spring Observatory in the National Park was damaged along with other buildings. However, Australia's largest telescope the Anglo-Australian survived.  The other major areas affected by fire were Yass, Cooma and the Shoalhaven. One house was destroyed in Jugiong and a volunteer firefighter sustained burn injuries in Gundaroo and was airlifted to Sydney for hospital treatment.  A recovery centre was opened in Coonabarabran after the fire. A recovery coordinator was appointed on 21 January by Barry O&rsquo;Farrell concentrating on supporting the Warrumbungles fire affected community.  Approximately 131,000 hectares were burnt in total across the state and extensive farm infrastructure and fences damaged. Approximately 12,000 sheep were lost at an estimated cost of over $1,000,000. Wildlife losses were also significant. The Department teamed with farmers to establish a fodder and fencing donation register to assist farmers rebuilding after the fires.  On 15 January, the New South Wales Premier, Barry O'Farrell, and the Federal Minister for Emergency Management, Nicola Roxon, announced Natural Disaster Assistance would be available to 51 Local Government Areas in New South Wales affected by bushfires. To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments were $1,015,600 for over 830 claimants.

3487,Disaster Event,Cyclone,"Tropical Cyclone Oswald formed in the Gulf of Carpentaria on 21 January 2013. It made landfall at night between Kowanyama,and Pormpuraaw on the west coast of Cape York Peninsula, as a weak category one system with winds up to 100 km per hour. The following morning, as the cyclone moved inland it was downgraded to a tropical low system. The low moved toward the east coast, near Cooktown on 23 January and then tracked slowly to the south-south-east just inland from the coast, impacting areas near Townsville on 24 January. The weather system stalled over the St. Lawrence-Rockhampton area on the 25th and 26th, and then tracked south to near Dalby west of Brisbane on the 28th, finally accelerating in a southerly direction eventually moving offshore south of Sydney on 29 January.  The ex-tropical cyclone brought with it a heavy monsoonal rainfall system that lasted for approximately one week. Most of the eastern areas of Queensland, and the coast of New South Wales ending in the Wollongong area experienced very heavy rainfall during the period from 22 to 29 January 2013. On 25 January, areas around Rockhampton recorded rainfall for a 24 hour period in excess of 300 mm. Rainfall for the areas between Rockhampton and Bundaberg alone were heavy enough to break the January monthly rainfall records. On 28 January, the most extreme daily rainfall for the week occurred over the Gold Coast Hinterland and New South Wales border catchment and the edge of the Brisbane river catchment where rainfall for a 24 hour period was in excess of 700 mm both hitting record levels. The Queensland State Emergency Service received 1800 calls for help in 24 hours on the 28 January, mostly in the south-east areas of the state.  Six people were killed due to the extreme weather over the course of the week. Thousands were forced to evacuate, 2000 people were isolated by floodwaters for some days requiring emergency supply drops. Approximately 40 water rescues took place by State Emergency Service volunteers.  Key infrastructure was damaged and destroyed, estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The rail service was closed between Cairns and Townsville, the Weipa port shut down for several days, airlines cancelled many domestic flights between New South Wales and Queensland, travellers were stranded as they tried to return home after the long weekend, 200 schools were closed on the first day of school for the year and the worst ever power outages occurred in Queensland affecting 283,000 properties.  On 27 January, the system moved south impacting Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast with damaging to destructive winds, torrential rain, dangerous surf and tidal inundation for a 24 hour period. Winds reached 131 km per hour at Cape Byron.&nbsp;Mt Crosby water treatment plant was shut down owing to turbidity in the Brisbane River. Water was released from the Wivenhoe dam from 91per cent to 88 per cent to cope with flood waters. Water was also released from North Pine Dam and Somerset Dam.  Torrential rainfall and flooding also occurred in northern New South Wales particularly near Lismore and Grafton where approximately 2000 evacuations occurred. The New South Wales State Emergency Service attended to&nbsp;more than&nbsp;2900 calls for assistance Eight New South Wales river systems had flood warnings in place. Coastal erosion of beaches was evidenced in these regions along with sea foam covering some roads and parks on the Gold and Sunshine Coasts.  Overall, Bundaberg was the worst affected city with 2000 homes and 200 businesses inundated with flood water. The Burnett river was running at approximately 70 km per hour and threatening houses. Despite a mandatory evacuation order issued to 5000 residents, an emergency airlift was the only option for some stranded residents. Eighteen helicopters were utilised in a rescue effort evacuating more than 1000 people trapped by flood waters in North Bundaberg and other most-at-risk areas to at least nine evacuation centres which was a record evacuation effort in Australia. The Bundaberg hospital was also evacuated and approximately 130 patients were transferred to hospitals in Brisbane.  On 31 January, in North Bundaberg, approximately 7000 residents were forced out of their homes and not allowed to return until they were checked and declared safe. Defence personnel, 180 in total, went house to house within an exclusion zone, conducting search and rescue operations. Defence personnel also helped to repair damaged infrastructure and clean people's homes as part of the initial recovery operation.  Financial assistance and grants were made available to eligible Queensland flood victims, including:    Queensland Floods Appeal 2013 payments  Emergent Assistance Grant  Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP)  Essential Services Safety and Reconnection Grant.    The Queensland government also provided financial help and support services to business owners and primary producers such as low interest loans and clean up and recovery grants. Other assistance included freight subsidies, Individual Disaster Stricken Property (IDSP) declarations and leasehold rent relief.  The Federal Attorney-General announced flood and storm victims, employees, small business persons and farmers could apply for the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments:    New South Wales - January 2013: $17,254,788 scheduled to be paid.  Queensland - January 2013:&nbsp; $141,449,554 scheduled to be paid.    Natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements were provided as a joint commonwealth and state / territory government initiative for local government areas.

3495,Disaster Event,Chemical,"On 21 August 1991 at approximately 2.17 pm, an explosion occurred on Coode Island in Melbourne when a 600,000 litre chemical storage tank filled with acrylonitrile exploded and caught fire. The fire burned various hazardous chemicals including acrylonitrile, phenol, methyl ethyl ketone and benzene forming clouds of potentially toxic black smoke up to 30 km from the site, prompting the evacuation of Footscray Primary School, nearby buildings and ships, and closure of roads. People were advised to stay inside with windows and doors closed to avoid smoke inhalation. Testing conducted later showed that the smoke was not a chemical hazard due largely to the heat of the fire and high winds helped to dissipate the smoke from the area.  It took 155 fire fighters approximately three hours to gain control of the fire and two were injured in the process. The following morning at approximately 11.45 am, a ruptured pipeline caused an explosion in another storage tank that sent a fireball into the sky. This fire spread to four other storage tanks and burned until control was gained at around 4 pm. Fire fighting efforts alone were estimated to cost $2 million as the fire control required large quantities of foam.  In total, approximately 16 chemical storage tanks were damaged or destroyed, with approximately 8.6 million litres of chemicals burnt and more leaking.  A Coronial Inquest was held 26 April 1994 to 20 May 1994, where 59 witnesses presented evidence. The findings of the Coronial Inquest were released 17 June 1994. The Coroner found on the balance of probabilities that a corona discharge occurred, igniting the chemicals within Tank 80. A corona discharge, colloquially known as St Elmo's fire, is akin to lightning, but in slow motion and with a much lower discharge of energy. The Coroner praised fire fighters and other emergency service personnel for their efforts in the response.  Damage and clean-up costs were later assessed at between $20 and $35 million. The owner of the facility was charged under environment protection and labour laws with the penalty imposed in the vicinity of $1.3 million. According to the Financial Review the owners held an insurance cover of $20 million which covered the replacement value of the facility in addition to public liability insurance. Therefore, the insurance cost of Coode Island is assessed as $21.3 million.",1991-08-21,22/08/1991,-37.81663132,144.916626,0,0,0,0,21300000,0,0,0,0,0,Victoria

Authorities removed the oysters from sale on 31 March after up to 60 people initially presented with gastroenteritis symptoms in Tasmania and investigations commenced.  The Public and Environmental Health Service of Tasmania advised that the source of the oyster contamination was a private sewage line nearby at Dunalley. Once the contamination source was identified a temporary closure of other small oyster harvest zones further out to sea occurred as a precaution pending further test results.  The volume of sewage leaking from the pipe was very low, and the leaking underground pipe was capped while the owner carried out repairs. Investigations confirmed oyster lease 113 was the only source of the oysters causing illness, affecting people interstate and in Tasmania.

Immediately after the incident members of the public rushed to the aid of those under the fallen bricks, trying to remove the debris until emergency services arrived. Two people died and another was critically injured and later died.  The cause of the collapse is subject to investigations, although it is believed that unusually strong winds contributed to the accident.

3575,Disaster Event,Tornado,"On 21 March 2013, at approximately 8 pm, a category F3 tornado with winds between 250 km per hour and 300 km per hour crossed north-east Victoria up to the border of New South Wales, impacting Koonoomoo, Rutherglen, Cobram, Yarrawonga, Bundalong, Euroa and Mulwala.  The tornado lasted only five minutes, but in this time the wind caused considerable destruction. Roofs were lifted off houses, caravans were overturned and some commercial buildings were severely damaged including the Cobram Barooga Golf Club, several historic buildings in the main street of Rutherglen, two caravan parks, a car dealership and a winery.  Approximately 24 people were injured, many from flying debris during the tornado. Four people were airlifted to Melbourne by Ambulance Victoria with serious injuries while others were treated locally in hospitals such as Yarrawonga where the local motels were utilised to ensure enough beds for patients.  The State Emergency Service received approximately 150 calls for assistance during this period, most requiring help with fallen trees blocking roads or damaging houses. The Hume Freeway, near Benalla, and the Murray Valley Highway at Bundalong were forced to close for a period of time until fallen trees were cleared. Disruptions occurred to local power and telecommunications services.  Approximately fifteen homes were deemed uninhabitable in Koonoomoo, seven in Bundalong and two in Rutherglen. Fourteen properties were badly damaged in Bundalong and 19 other properties sustained damaged across the region. It is estimated over 100 caravans were damaged by the wind.  Orchards and vineyards across Mulwala, Yarrawonga, Bundalong, Koonoomoo and Rutherglen were also impacted by the tornado. One peach grower in Koonoomoo had 2000 fruit trees flattened by the winds, causing damage in excess of $100,000.  The federal and state governments agreed to provide emergency financial assistance for those affected by the tornadoes. Recovery efforts were hindered by scattered debris, for example, in some locations there are sheets of iron high up trees and asbestos has been uncovered in the damage.  The Insurance Council of Australia stated it is unlikely to declare the incident a catastrophe, based on the damage evidenced to date.

The outbreak affected approximately 140 people, with many presenting at emergency departments, and more than 15 requiring hospitalisation. Hospitals in the Canberra region had to call in extra staff to deal with the numbers of patients and activate emergency response plans normally used in the event of winter influenza.  The symptoms of salmonella including diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever were found to have been caused by raw egg in mayonnaise used in potato salad.

Temperatures peaked throughout Australia, forcing the Bureau of Meteorology to add new colours (deep purple and pink) to its weather forecasting chart to record temperatures above 50&deg;C.  Australia&rsquo;s first six days of 2013 were among the hottest 20 days on record in terms of average maximums. The heatwave developed over a large region stretching from northern Victoria and inland New South Wales to central-west Queensland, across to north-western Western Australia and down to the Nullarbor coast.The national average maximum across Australia on 7 January was 40.33 &deg;C, beating the previous record set in 1972 by 0.16&deg;C.  In Perth, temperatures exceeded 37&deg;C for seven consecutive days. This heatwave caused 20 people to be hospitalised between the period 27 December and 3 January.

4781,Disaster Event,Bushfire,"During October 2013, approximately 100 fires burnt across eastern New South Wales, including six major bushfires. The most serious fires started in the Blue Mountains on 16 and 17 October.  The fires began on 13 October when strong winds and high temperatures caused a fire near Port Stephens and destroyed six houses. Several sheds and cars were also burnt in the fires and dozens of residents spent the night in evacuation centres. One person died at Lake Munmorah while protecting their home. Fires also occurred around the Hunter and Hawksbury regions. At the same time, more than 100 firefighters were fighting bushfires at Tangory Mountain, Webbs Creek, Wollemi National Park, the Southern Highlands and the Central Coast.  On 16 October, a defence training exercise at Marrangaroo near the Blue Mountains, accidently sparked a fire that became known as the &lsquo;State Mine Fire&rsquo;. It had a perimeter of 190km and eventually burnt nearly 46,000 hectares between Lithgow and Mt Tomah. At its most severe, the fire travelled 25 km per hour through bushland.  Thousands of people in Lithgow were evacuated and the communities of Bell, Bilpin, Berambing, Clarence, Dargan, Hartley Vale, Mount Wilson were also affected. The fire devastated the recently restored tourist attraction, Zig Zag Railway, with equipment and train carriages destroyed.  On 17 October two more major fires began in the lower Blue Mountains: one near Mt Victoria and the other at Springwood. Wimallee and Yellowrock were the worst affected communities with 193 homes destroyed and 100 damaged. Staff and patients at the Springwood Hospital were evacuated as a precaution. With the three fires burning uncontrollably in the Blue Mountains, on 18 October, Victoria sent fire crews and equipment to assist with the NSW firefighting efforts. A State of Emergency was announced for NSW on 20 October.  By 22 October the State Mine Fire had travelled south and was threatening to join up with the Mt Victoria Fire. The Rural Fire Service decided to deliberately allow the State Mine Fire to join the Mount Victoria Fire in a controlled way by managing fuel loads and back-burning to create firebreaks. While this was a high risk strategy, by 25 October cooler weather conditions allowed firefighters to bring the three Blue Mountains Fires under control. The fires were declared extinguished on 13 November. A total of approximately 118,000 hectares was burnt across the state.

The fire eventually burnt 52,000 hectares including bushland and farms and was declared contained on 21 January 2014. Many residents from Dadswell&rsquo;s Gap, Wartook, Brimpean, St Helen&rsquo;s Plain, Roses Gap Pomonal, Bellfield, Lake Fyans, Lake Lonsdale, Heatherlie and Ledcourt were affected by the fires. Halls Gap was threatened by the fire front and ember attack and most of the town evacuated. Relief centres were set up in Horsham, Stawell and Ararat for the hundreds of people who were evacuated from their homes. Farmers lost large numbers of sheep that were either killed by the fire or later culled. At least 7000 sheep in total were lost.  A 12 km wide pyro cumulus cloud column of smoke and fire was created by the fire, generating its own weather pattern including lightning and thunder. This cloud gathered burning embers into the sky, which then scattered for many kilometres beyond the fire front, potentially starting new fires.  Once the fire was contained, emergency services began assisting people to return to their homes and cleaning up the tourist attractions in time for visitors to be able to come to the Grampians National Park over the Australia Day long weekend.

At least 2000 cattle drowned.  &nbsp;  Western Australia&rsquo;s Department of Agriculture and Food estimated the damage to be $90 million.",2010-12-15,20/12/2010,-24.83908844,113.7496948,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Queensland
5015,Disaster Event,Bushfire,"In early February 2014, Victoria faced its worst fire conditions since Black Saturday in 2009. Over the weekend of 8 and 9 February, the Country Fire Authority (CFA) was at its highest state of readiness with interstate and New Zealand colleagues on standby.  While existing fires continued to burn in East Gippsland, new fires broke out on 9 February in the Latrobe Valley and north of Melbourne at Mickleham, Gisborne, Riddells Creek&nbsp;and Warrandyte. Six thousand firefighters were mobilised across the state and thousands of people evacuated.  High winds and very dry conditions resulted in three homes&nbsp;destroyed in Warrandyte, one in Gisborne and one in Morwell before these fires were brought under control. However, a fire in the Hazelwood Mine at Morwell continued to burn (see the Hazelwood Mine entry for further information on this disaster).  The Mickleham Road Complex was a fast moving grassfire that remained out of control for a number of days. It split into two fire-fronts threatening both Kilmore and Wallan. The fire also impacted the communities of Beveridge, Darraweit Guim, Springwood, Chintin, Forbes and Bylands, Wallan, Willowmavin and Craigieburn. Once the Mickleham fire was contained, the threat of smouldering trees falling continued amongst the fire affected areas. A total of 13 homes were&nbsp;destroyed as well as other farm infrastructure and approximately 10,000 sheep and 600 cattle also perished.  While the East Gippsland fires continued to burn in remote bushland, by 14 February the fire no longer posed a threat to private property. More than 130,000 hectares were burnt and 15 homes destroyed. Approximately 100 farm properties were also affected with stock and fencing losses.  The Victorian Government announced people affected by the fires would have immediate access to grants of up to $30,000 if their homes were destroyed or significantly damaged due to the fire. The Commonwealth and Victorian Governments National Disaster Recovery Payments were also made available to those affected by the fires.",2014-02-09,14/02/2014,-37.56471634,144.8931885,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Victoria
5041,Disaster Event,Complex Emergencies,"The Hazelwood open cut mine fire began on 9 February 2014, during the worst fire conditions in Victoria since Black Saturday. It was started by a nearby grassfire and was one of 70 blazes across the state during this time. The fire continued burning for four weeks, with the Victorian Country Fire Authority (CFA) declaring it under control on 19 February 2014 and safe on 25 March 2014. It was a complex disaster for three reasons; firstly, the size of the fire and magnitude of the firefighting efforts, secondly, the public health emergency for the responders and people of Morwell and thirdly, the financial cost of the disaster.  Morwell is located close to the Hazelwood mine, with some people living 400 metres from the mine site. The fire released large amounts of smoke and ash that settled on the communities of Morwell. Twenty firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation and hundreds of people in Morwell complained of breathing problems over the duration of the fire. People also reported poor visibility and an unpleasant odour, meaning that they couldn&rsquo;t spend extended time outdoors  The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) was responsible for monitoring air quality and reporting to government. Acknowledging the poor air quality and discomfort faced by the people of Morwell, the Victorian Government suggested people have short breaks from Morwell, made health checks available and distributed face masks. On 28 February, the Victorian Chief Health Officer, Rosemary Lester advised that the elderly, sick, children and pregnant women should temporarily leave South Morwell. The Federal and Victorian governments provided grants of up to $1250 to assist with their temporary relocation.  Many schools and childcare centres in Morwell closed and relocated students during the fire. A County Court Judge was forced to postpone a trial held in Morwell due to the smoke and poor air conditions. &nbsp;  Hazelwood was the most serious mine fire in Australian history, with advice and support obtained from local and international experts in the field. Mine fires are very difficult to control, particularly if the coal seam begins to burn as was the case at Hazelwood. More than 7000 firefighters from the CFA, interstate agencies and the mine owners were deployed over the 45 days. They used water and foam to cool the fire down and then dug out the burning coal, spraying it with water. This is a very time consuming process. More than 500 firefighters battled the fire at any one time, with 86,000 litres of water used per minute.  A number of homes have been badly damaged by ash and fire, including their interiors.  The Victorian Government announced on 11 March 2014, that former Supreme Court Justice Bernard Teague will head an inquiry into the mine fire.  The Victorian Government also announced on 18 March 2014, a two million dollar package to assist with the clean up following the Hazelwood fire. Morwell residents will be able to access some of these funds and further details will be provided as they become available.",2014-02-09,19/03/2014,-38.23251724,146.3935089,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Victoria
5044,Disaster Event,Transport,"On 22 March 2014, a light aircraft owned by a Caboolture skydiving company crashed shortly after take-off at Caboolture airfield. The plane failed to reach 60 metres before diving on to a crossing runway and bursting into flames, killing the pilot and all four passengers on board.  The Australian Transport Safety Bureau will prepare a preliminary report by the end of April 2014, while the Australian Parachute Federation announced it will make its own investigation into the incident.  Further details will be provided as they become available.",2014-03-22,22/03/2014,-27.03710938,152.9489136,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,Queensland
