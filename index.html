                        <p><strong>The southeast of Australia, where cities like Sydney and Melbourne are located, shows many overlapping disasters, making it a high-risk area. In the northern regions, cyclones and floods are more common, reflecting the tropical climate.</strong> This map highlights the need for specific disaster response plans tailored to each region’s unique risks.</p>

                            <p>The chart shows how the cost of disasters in Australia has increased over time, from <strong>1975 to 2020</strong>. The spikes represent major events like <strong>bushfires, floods, and cyclones, which caused the most damage.</strong> Over the years, these events have become more expensive, reflecting both more frequent disasters and the higher value of damaged property.</p>

                        <p>The chart shows that bushfire activity is <strong>highest between October and January, with December 2019 having the most significant impact.</strong> This highlights how dangerous the summer months are for bushfires in Australia, making it essential for people in these areas to prepare in advance.</p>

The <strong>southern and eastern states, like Victoria and New South Wales, are hit harder, while the northern regions are less affected.</strong> This shows that different areas need different levels of support and preparation for bushfires.</p>
